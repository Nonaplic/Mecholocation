NOTE: All of the content for this mod can be found in a dungeon accessible only from a portal made at the Arcanist's Workbench. If you would like to quickly experience the dungeon the way it was intended, I suggest going into creative mode, giving yourself Thorium/Cobalt armor & weapons (in addition to some health items), and then crafting the portal before switching to adventure mode. 

Make your way into an ancient structure filled with magical advanced technology, but be warned: the protectors still function! These robotic bats react to any sound they hear, so you MAY be able to sneak past them... IF you are careful not to set off any traps. A great reward remains, and can be claimed by any who are strong enough to endure these halls. 

Will you be the Hero to evade Mecholocation?
